## Proposal
Did you hear about the latest headline claiming a celebrity turned into an avocado? No? Well, that’s exactly the kind of fake news-and viral satire-that floods our social media feeds every day. These outrageous posts are as wild as your uncle’s conspiracy theories after one too many holiday dinners. Scrolling through your feed can feel like diving into a maze of confusing and sometimes hilarious stories that make you question reality (and your family gatherings). 

Our proposal is to build a model that takes in everything from suspicious headlines to eyebrow-raising tweets and tells you whether you’re about to share real news, clickbait, or the latest viral joke-saving you from spreading “BREAKING: Celebrity Turns Into Avocado” level nonsense.
